Create a program that will play the Greed Game. Rules for the game are in GREED_RULES.md
You already have a DiceSet class and score function you can use (written as part of the ruby [koans](http://rubykoans.com/)). Write a player class and a Game class to complete the project.

Ruby version expected: v2.6.6
Also add RSpecs (Unit tests) along with the code. Rspec version 3.10.x
