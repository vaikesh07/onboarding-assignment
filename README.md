# Ruby Koans Assignment: Journey to Enlightenment

This repository contains my completed solutions for the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/), a wonderful and interactive learning environment that guides you through the Ruby programming language using a test-driven approach.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to evaluate the assignment and experience the "Enlightenment" yourself.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Ruby:** Version 2.6.x, 2.7.x, 3.x (any recent stable version should work, though some older Koan tests might have version-specific behaviors).
    * You can check your Ruby version by running:
        ```bash
        ruby -v
        ```
    * If Ruby is not installed, it's recommended to use a Ruby version manager like `rbenv` or `RVM`.

* **Rake Gem:** Rake is Ruby's build program, and it's used to run the Koan tests.
    * Install it via RubyGems:
        ```bash
        gem install rake
        ```

### Installation
